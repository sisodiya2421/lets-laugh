# lets-laugh

A web application that detects a smile on your face and then shows a random funny sticker, while you are watching a funny video. The video that my web application suggests is randomly picked every time you load the page.

```sh
npm install

npm start
```

App URL: https://lets-laugh-persistent-oryx-ce.eu-gb.mybluemix.net/
